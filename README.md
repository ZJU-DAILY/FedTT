# FedTT

Traffic prediction aims to forecast future traffic conditions using historical traffic data, serving a crucial role in urban computing and transportation management. While transfer learning and federated learning have been employed to address the scarcity of traffic data by transferring traffic knowledge from data-rich to data-scarce cities without traffic data exchange, existing approaches in Federated Traffic Knowledge Transfer (FTT) still face several critical challenges such as potential privacy leakage, cross-city data distribution discrepancies, and low data quality, hindering their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this end, we present FedTT, a novel privacy-aware and efficient federated learning framework for cross-city traffic knowledge transfer. Specifically, our proposed framework includes four key innovations: (i) a traffic view imputation method for missing traffic data completion to enhance data quality, (ii) a traffic domain adapter for uniform traffic data transformation to address data distribution discrepancies, and (iii) a traffic secret aggregation protocol for secure traffic data aggregation to safeguard data privacy. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed FedTT framework outperforms the 14 state-of-the-art baselines.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment

Python.version = 3.9.21

Other dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.

All the experiments are conducted in the federated environment on four nodes, one as a server and the other three as clients, each equipped with two Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4@2.20GHz 12-core processors, 128GB of RAM, and a Internet speed of 100MB/s.
